# ABSTRACT

Air quality plays a significant role in peopleâ€™s respiratory health. In this paper, we use Air Quality Index (AQI) defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) using 6 major air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, O3, SO2) for quantifying air quality. First, we calculated population-weighted exposure to air pollution for 9,123 neighborhoods in Seoul over four months, based on hourly floating population data derived from mobile network usage. We visualized these patterns using GIS software to identify areas with the highest active population exposure, separated by age group. Then, we analyzed air quality impacts on working age and elderly populations in the Yeouido district of Seoul, where both groups were highly exposed during this period. As a result, the elderly group population remain similar or even increase in high polluted day (high AQI) compared to high reduction of population in working age groups. The response pattern show that elderly could have more harmful effects due to their less sensitive to air pollution.
