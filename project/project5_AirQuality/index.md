# ABSTRACT

Air quality plays a significant role in peopleâ€™s respiratory health. In this paper, we use Air Quality Index (AQI) defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) using 6 major air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, O3, SO2) for quantifying air quality. First, we calculated population-weighted exposure to air pollution for 9,123 neighborhoods in Seoul over four months, based on hourly floating population data derived from mobile network usage. We visualized these patterns using GIS software to identify areas with the highest active population exposure, separated by age group. Then, we analyzed air quality impacts on working age and elderly populations in the Yeouido district of Seoul, where both groups were highly exposed during this period. We found that the elderly population remained similar or even increased on highly polluted days (high AQI) compared to high reduction of population among working age groups. This response pattern suggests that elderly populations may not adjusting their behavior to avoid exposure to air pollution. For further research, a smaller scale of floating population is needed to distinguish whether people stay in buildings or not. In addition, Statistical tests would be conducted to verify AQI and human response among different age groups.
Keywords: Air quality index (AQI); Air pollution; Human exposure; Human response pattern
